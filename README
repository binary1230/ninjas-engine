-------------------
HACKING ON THE GAME
-------------------

Try messing with stuff in data/
The entire game is controlled via a series of XML files.

The game initial reads data/default.xml and includes the other XML files.

You can customize pretty much everything by modifying things in those XML
files.

NOTE: You MUST have the following at the top of EVERY XML FILE:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

Happy hacking! Have fun!

THIS CODE IS REALLY OLD
-----------------------

I made this back in college in 2006 and resurrected it from the dead 10 years later.  
I am not proud of a lot of things in here :)
I don't recommend anyone write their own game engine in C++ these days, use something like Unity or at least program in Python or C#
